    abstract = "The disambiguation of causative-passive homonymy (CPH) is potentially tricky for machines, as the causative and the passive are not distinguished by the sentences{'} syntactic structure. By transforming CPH disambiguation to a challenging natural language inference (NLI) task, we present the first Chinese Adversarial NLI challenge set (CANLI). We show that the pretrained transformer model RoBERTa, fine-tuned on an existing large-scale Chinese NLI benchmark dataset, performs poorly on CANLI. We also employ Word Sense Disambiguation as a probing task to investigate to what extent the CPH feature is captured in the model{'}s internal representation. We find that the model{'}s performance on CANLI does not correspond to its internal representation of CPH, which is the crucial linguistic ability central to the CANLI dataset. CANLI is available on Hugging Face Datasets (Lhoest et al., 2021) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/sxu/CANLI",
